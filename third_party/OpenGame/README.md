## Abstract

> Game development sits at the intersection of creative design and intricate software engineering, demanding the joint orchestration of game engines, real-time loops, and tightly coupled state across many files. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents now solve isolated programming tasks with ease, they consistently stumble when asked to produce a fully playable game from a high-level design, collapsing under cross-file inconsistencies, broken scene wiring, and logical incoherence. We bridge this gap with **OpenGame**, the first open-source agentic framework explicitly designed for end-to-end web game creation. At its core lies **Game Skill**, a reusable, evolving capability composed of a *Template Skill* that grows a library of project skeletons from experience and a *Debug Skill* that maintains a living protocol of verified fixes—together enabling the agent to scaffold stable architectures and systematically repair integration errors rather than patch isolated syntax bugs. Powering this framework is **GameCoder-27B**, a code LLM specialized for game engine mastery through a three-stage pipeline of continual pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and execution-grounded reinforcement learning. Since verifying interactive playability is fundamentally harder than checking static code, we further introduce **OpenGame-Bench**, an evaluation pipeline that scores agentic game generation along Build Health, Visual Usability, and Intent Alignment via headless browser execution and VLM judging. Across 150 diverse game prompts, OpenGame establishes a new state-of-the-art. We hope OpenGame pushes code agents beyond discrete software engineering problems and toward building complex, interactive real-world applications.

**To run a demo locally:**

```bash
unzip demo_*.zip && cd demo_*
npm install
npm run dev   # opens at http://localhost:5173
```

## Installation

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Node.js 20+
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### From source (recommended while we prepare the npm release)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leigest519/OpenGame.git
cd OpenGame
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

This exposes the `opengame` command on your `PATH`.

## Quick Start

OpenGame is currently driven from the command line in **headless mode** —
you give it a one-shot prompt and it builds the game end-to-end.

```bash
# Create an empty folder for your new game
cd agent-test
mkdir -p games/my-game && cd games/my-game

# Generate the game from a single prompt
opengame -p "Build a Snake clone with WASD controls and a dark theme." --yolo
```

When the agent finishes, open the generated `index.html` (or run the printed
dev-server command) in your browser to play your game.

> If you prefer to create games anywhere on disk, set absolute paths instead:
>
> ```bash
> export GAME_TEMPLATES_DIR="/absolute/path/to/OpenGame/agent-test/templates"
> export GAME_DOCS_DIR="/absolute/path/to/OpenGame/agent-test/docs"
> ```
>
> Headless runs auto-elevate the approval mode to `auto-edit` so the agent
> can write/edit files. Shell commands stay disabled by default — pass
> `--yolo` (or `--approval-mode yolo`) if you want the agent to also run
> shell commands. See
> [`docs/users/features/headless.md`](docs/users/features/headless.md) for
> the full headless reference.

#### Authentication

OpenGame's agent runtime supports an OpenAI-compatible API. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"     # optional
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"                            # optional, swap in GameCoder-27B when running it locally
```

#### Asset / GDD provider keys (image, video, audio, reasoning)

Beyond the main agent LLM, OpenGame's asset-generation tools talk to image,
video, and audio providers. You bring your own keys for each — OpenGame ships
with no defaults. Each modality is configured **independently**, so you can
mix providers (e.g. DashScope for image, Doubao for video, OpenAI for
reasoning):

```bash
export OPENGAME_IMAGE_PROVIDER=tongyi         # tongyi | doubao | openai-compat
export OPENGAME_IMAGE_API_KEY=sk-...
# ...and similarly for OPENGAME_REASONING_*, OPENGAME_VIDEO_*, OPENGAME_AUDIO_*
```

A complete env-var reference, settings.json schema, and examples for OpenAI /
fal.ai / OpenRouter / DashScope / Doubao live in
[`docs/users/configuration/api-keys.md`](docs/users/configuration/api-keys.md).
A copy-paste template is at [`.env.example`](.env.example).

OpenGame prints a one-line provider-status banner at startup so you can
confirm which modalities are wired up before the run begins.

## Game Skill

OpenGame's agent is bootstrapped with **Game Skill**, a reusable capability split into two parts:

- **Template Skill** — picks an appropriate engine/template (canvas, Phaser, three.js, etc.) and scaffolds a stable, conventional project structure so later edits stay coherent.
- **Debug Skill** — runs the game in a sandbox, catches integration errors, console errors, and broken interactions, and systematically resolves them until the game is playable end-to-end.

Together they let the agent move from "writes plausible code" to "ships a working game."

## Configuration

OpenGame can be configured via `settings.json`, environment variables, and CLI flags.

- **User settings**: `~/.qwen/settings.json`
- **Project settings**: `.qwen/settings.json`

> The on-disk settings directory is currently still named `.qwen` for backward compatibility with the upstream agent runtime. We plan to migrate this to `.opengame` in a future release.

## GameCoder-27B

`GameCoder-27B` is a Code LLM purpose-built for OpenGame. It is trained with:

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** on curated game-development trajectories covering engine APIs, project scaffolding, and bug-fix workflows.
2. **Reinforcement Learning** with reward signals derived from real game playability (using OpenGame-Bench-style verifiers).

## OpenGame-Bench

`OpenGame-Bench` is a benchmark for evaluating agents that build interactive web games. Unlike static code-evaluation benchmarks, it dynamically launches generated games, drives them with scripted interactions, and verifies playability criteria (rendering, controls, game-loop progression, win/loss states, etc.).

The evaluation pipeline will be released soon.

## Acknowledgments

OpenGame builds on the excellent open-source work of:

- **[qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)** — the agent runtime and CLI scaffolding that OpenGame extends with Game Skill, GameCoder-27B integration, and OpenGame-Bench tooling.
- **[Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** — the original CLI architecture that qwen-code is itself based on.
- **[Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)** — the fast, free, and open-source HTML5 game framework used for game rendering and mechanics.

We thank these teams and communities for making their work openly available.
