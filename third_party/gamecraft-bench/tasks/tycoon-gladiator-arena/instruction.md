# Gladiator Arena

Build **Gladiator Arena**, a **gladiator arena management tycoon game** in
Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`. This is not a prototype. It is a **complete,
shippable micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished
vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player owns a gladiatorial arena in a fantasy-Roman setting, recruiting
fighters, training them, scheduling bouts, and upgrading the arena to attract
bigger crowds and richer sponsors. Each gladiator has stats, a fighting style,
and a personality — some are crowd favorites who draw spectators, others are
efficient killers who win but bore the audience. The tension is between
spectacle and survival: the crowd wants blood and drama, but dead gladiators
are expensive to replace. Betting adds a layer of risk-reward: the player can
wager on their own fighters for extra gold, but upsets happen. The tone is
sand-and-steel grandeur: roaring crowds, clashing weapons, and the drama of
the arena floor.

## What the Player Experiences

From the title screen the player starts a new arena season. The main view
shows the arena compound: training grounds, barracks, the arena floor, and a
management office. Time advances day by day toward scheduled fight nights.

Gladiators are recruited from a slave market or free-fighter pool — each has
combat stats (strength, speed, defense), a weapon preference, and a crowd
appeal rating. Training improves stats over days but costs food and trainer
fees. The player assigns training regimens: strength drills, sparring, or
showmanship practice.

Fight nights are scheduled on the calendar. The player picks matchups from
their roster against visiting challengers or rival arena fighters. During
fights, gladiators battle automatically based on their stats and style — the
player watches but cannot intervene. Crowd excitement builds with dramatic
moments (near-deaths, comebacks, finishing moves).

Revenue comes from ticket sales (based on crowd size), sponsor deals (based on
arena prestige), and betting winnings. Expenses include gladiator upkeep,
training costs, arena maintenance, and medical bills for injured fighters.

The game tracks gold, arena prestige, and season wins. A styled result screen
shows season statistics and champion gladiator highlights.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    <- your input traces (1-10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1-10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280x720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280x720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
