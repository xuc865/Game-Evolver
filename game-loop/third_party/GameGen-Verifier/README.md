# GameGen-Verifier: State-Grounded Verification for Game Generation

This repository is the reference implementation of **GameGen-Verifier** and
its execution substrate **GGV-Harness**. It contains the experiment pipeline
used to generate, evaluate, and aggregate browser-game verification tasks.
This is an anonymized code release for double-blind review: generated games,
run outputs, logs, screenshots, cached dependencies, and private
configuration files are intentionally not included.

## Repository Layout

Core artifacts (the two halves of GGV-Harness):

- `harness/`: GGV-Harness Python implementation -- evaluation drivers, backend abstraction, queue/quota control.
- `skills/`: worker-side prompts (verifier contracts) consumed by both backends -- see [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md). Codex finds them via the `.codex/skills` symlink; Claude Code finds them via the top-level `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the repo registers itself as the `gamegen-verifier` plugin).

Pipeline glue:

- `scripts/run_all_experiments.py`: one-command launcher for the end-to-end pipeline.
- `scripts/prepare/`: generate games, distill keypoints, and export hook-stripped copies.
- `scripts/ablation/`: parallel-vs-sequential keypoint ablation.
- `scripts/common/`: cross-cutting utilities (game catalog, keypoint policy).

Inputs and (git-ignored) outputs:

- `games/`: generated evaluation-enabled game projects (not committed).
- `games_clean/`: generated copies with the evaluation adapter stripped (not committed).
- `runs/`: generated evaluation outputs (not committed).
- `experiments/`: per-launch summary directories written by the launcher (not committed).
- `tools/playwright/`: shared Playwright dependency declaration.
- `tests/`: unit tests for the pipeline code.
- `docs/harness.md`: tour of the harness substrate (where each piece lives).
- `docs/pipeline.md`: end-to-end data flow.

## Quickstart

Three steps from a fresh clone to a verified install (no backend calls
needed for steps 1 and 2):

```bash
# 1. Install Python and Playwright dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
( cd tools/playwright && npm install && npm run install:chromium )

# 2. Verify the install (runs unit tests + --help on every entry point)
python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py --smoke

# 3. Authenticate the coding-agent backend, then launch one game
codex login                                 # one-time, only for --backend codex
python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py --games tetris
```

Step 3 launches the full pipeline (`prepare -> ours -> recheck`) for one
game. End-to-end runtime is roughly **5–15 minutes per game** depending on
backend latency and keypoint count. Outputs land under `runs/tetris/`
and `experiments/all_runs/launch_<timestamp>/summary.json`.

## Available Example Games

`descriptions_example/` ships with 10 game descriptions in the input format
the pipeline expects. Pick any of them as `--games <name>`:

```text
neon_maze_escape       card_battle_coliseum    monument_valley
tetris                 block_world_frontier    plants_vs_zombies
orbital_invaders       property_tycoon_3d
gem_match_temple       temple_run_2
```

Drop a new `<game_name>.md` into `descriptions_example/` to add your own;
no other registration is required.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 20 or newer, npm
- A coding-agent CLI backend for full runs -- one of `codex` or `claude`
  must be on your `PATH`. Authenticate it once before launching:
  - `codex` -> `codex login` (uses your OpenAI account)
  - `claude` -> `claude login` (uses your Anthropic account)
  - Pass `--backend <name>` to select between them.

Generated games are Vite/TypeScript projects. Their per-game dependencies
are installed automatically by the evaluation lifecycle script when a game
is run.

## One-Click Run

```bash
# Full pipeline for one or more games
python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py --games neon_maze_escape tetris

# Pick phases explicitly (default is "prepare ours")
python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py \
  --games tetris \
  --phases prepare ours ablation \
  --repeats 3 \
  --backend codex

# Local smoke check (no backend calls)
python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py --smoke
```

See `python3 scripts/run_all_experiments.py --help` for the full flag list.

## Manual Pipeline

If you want finer control than the launcher, the same steps run as
individual scripts:

```bash
# 1. Prepare (one-time per game)
python3 scripts/prepare/generate_games.py --games <game_name> --skip-export
python3 scripts/prepare/distill_keypoints.py --games <game_name>
python3 scripts/prepare/export_clean_games.py --games <game_name> --force

# 2. Evaluate
python3 harness/run_normal_eval.py \
  --workspace "$(pwd)" --game-name <game_name> --run-id demo_normal
python3 harness/run_recheck_eval.py \
  --workspace "$(pwd)" --game-name <game_name> --run-id demo_normal

# 3. Optional: parallel-vs-sequential ablation
python3 scripts/ablation/parallel_keypoints.py \
  --games <game_name> --repeats 3
```

Expected files after `prepare`:

```text
games/<game_name>/{src/, package.json, data.md, state_injection_api.md, keypoints.md}
games_clean/<game_name>/package.json
```

## Expected Output

Normal evaluation (`harness/run_normal_eval.py`) writes:

```text
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/summary_report.md      # per-keypoint PASS/FAIL listing
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/evaluation_report.md   # tabular summary
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/keypoint_<id>/result.json
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/keypoint_<id>/screenshots/{before,after}.png
```

Recheck (`harness/run_recheck_eval.py`) writes:

```text
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/recheck_summary.md
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/recheck_comparison.json
runs/<game_name>/<run_id>/keypoint_<id>/recheck_result.json
```

The launcher (`scripts/run_all_experiments.py`) additionally writes a
per-launch summary at:

```text
experiments/all_runs/launch_<timestamp>/summary.json
```

`runs/` and `experiments/` are git-ignored.

- `docs/harness.md` -- where the harness substrate lives across
  `harness/`, `scripts/common/`, and `skills/`.
- `docs/skills.md` -- skill format, install, and how Codex / Claude Code each
  discover and consume them.
- `docs/pipeline.md` -- end-to-end data flow.
