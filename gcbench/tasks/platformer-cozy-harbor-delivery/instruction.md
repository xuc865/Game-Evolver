# Cozy Harbor Delivery

Build **Cozy Harbor Delivery**, a 2D top-down delivery routing mini-game in
Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`. This is not a prototype. It is a **complete,
shippable micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished
vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A small courier boat putters through a sun-dappled harbor, weaving between
islands and buoys to ferry parcels from pickup crates to waiting dock customers.
The tension lives in the routing: multiple orders tick down simultaneously, each
with a different destination and urgency, and the harbor is just tangled enough
that the player cannot serve everyone on a straight line. Choosing which parcel
to grab first, which customer to disappoint, and when to risk a tight shortcut
between moored hulls is the entire decision space. Between shifts the player
reinvests earnings into speed, cargo capacity, or route hints, shaping how the
next shift feels. The tone is warm and unhurried on the surface but quietly
demanding underneath — a cozy logistics puzzle wrapped in watercolor docks and
bobbing boats.

## What the Player Experiences

A styled title screen sets the mood: the game name, a harbor map illustration,
and a courier boat identity greet the player before they press Start.

The shift begins on a top-down harbor map alive with water lanes, wooden docks,
rocky islands, painted buoys, and waiting customers. The player steers the boat
smoothly through the water, feeling it slow near obstacles and bounce off island
edges. Picking up a crate changes the boat's silhouette or HUD loadout,
confirming what is aboard and where it needs to go.

Orders stack up on the screen — each with a destination marker and a countdown.
Some are leisurely, others flash urgent. The player threads routes, drops
parcels at matching customers, and watches coins or reputation tick upward with
each successful delivery. Miss a timer and the customer frowns away. A day timer
or shift meter counts down the round, escalating the pressure as remaining
orders pile up.

When the shift ends, a result screen tallies deliveries, earnings, and a
performance rating. Between shifts an upgrade or planning screen offers choices
that change the next run — faster engine, bigger hold, better route hints. The
loop invites one more shift, then one more after that.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    ← your input traces (1–10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
