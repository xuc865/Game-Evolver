# Pirate Fleet

Build **Pirate Fleet**, a **naval tactics strategy game with wind mechanics** in
Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`. This is not a prototype. It is a **complete,
shippable micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished
vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A fleet of pirate ships navigates a hex-sea where wind direction dictates
everything. Sailing with the wind is fast; tacking against it is slow and
costly. The player commands multiple ship types — nimble sloops, heavy
galleons, boarding frigates — positioning them to exploit wind advantage while
denying it to the enemy. Combat is broadside-based: ships deal damage from
their flanks, so facing matters as much as range. Treasure islands dot the map
as objectives worth fighting over. The tone is golden-age piracy: sun-bleached
sails, cannon smoke, and the creak of timber under fire.

## What the Player Experiences

From the title screen the player selects a scenario or campaign mission. The
map shows a hex-grid sea with islands, shallows, and a wind-direction indicator
that shifts every few turns. The player's fleet starts on one side; the enemy
on the other. Treasure islands sit between them as objectives.

Each turn the player moves ships. Movement cost depends on direction relative
to wind: downwind is cheap, crosswind moderate, upwind expensive. Ships have
limited movement points per turn. After moving, ships with enemies in their
broadside arc can fire cannons — damage depends on range and facing angle.

Ship types serve different roles: sloops scout and flank quickly, galleons
absorb damage and carry heavy guns, and frigates can initiate boarding actions
on adjacent ships for a chance to capture rather than sink. Captured ships join
the player's fleet.

Treasure islands are captured by moving a ship adjacent and holding for one
turn. Controlling islands earns victory points. The scenario ends when one side
reaches the point target or loses all ships. A styled result screen shows the
battle outcome with ships sunk, captured, and treasure claimed.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    <- your input traces (1-10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1-10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280x720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280x720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
