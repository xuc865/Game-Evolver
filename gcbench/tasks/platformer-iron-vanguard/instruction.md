# Iron Vanguard

Build **Iron Vanguard**, a 2D top-down grid-based tactical tank defense game in
Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`. This is not a prototype. It is a **complete,
shippable micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished
vertical slice.

## Core Vision

A lone armored tank holds the line against relentless waves of automated
warmachines bearing down on a critical command core. The tension lives in
positioning and restraint: movement is grid-locked, only one shell can exist on
screen at a time, and every shot must count because the enemy never stops
advancing. The player is always choosing between pushing forward to intercept a
flanking column and falling back to guard the core from a breakthrough. Terrain
shapes every engagement — brick barricades offer temporary cover until they
crumble, steel walls funnel traffic into kill zones, and mud patches punish
careless repositioning. The risk is always the same: one shell slips past, one
enemy reaches the core, and the defense collapses instantly. The tone is gritty
dieselpunk — rust-iron plating, neon hazard lines, deep shadows, and the
percussive flash of shell impacts.

## What the Player Experiences

A dark industrial title screen sets the mood before the player enters a tactical
map showing available defense zones. Each zone is a distinct battlefield with its
own layout and enemy composition, inviting the player to choose where to make
their stand.

Combat drops the player's tank onto a grid battlefield adjacent to the glowing
command core. The field is a maze of destructible brick walls, impenetrable steel
barriers, and treacherous mud patches. Enemies pour from spawn points at the top
of the screen in waves, each wave more aggressive than the last. Some enemies
rush the core directly, others hunt the player, and specialized carriers glow
with salvageable cargo.

The player steers with grid-locked directional inputs and fires a single shell at
a time — no spray-and-pray, just deliberate aim. Destroying a carrier drops
battlefield salvage: armor repairs, temporary fortifications around the core, or
an EMP pulse that freezes everything on screen. Taking hits degrades the tank's
hull layer by layer; lose all armor and a life is spent.

Victory comes when the last enemy in the wave queue is destroyed, rewarding the
player with accuracy metrics and unlocking the next zone. Defeat is instant if
the core takes a single hit, or gradual if lives run out. Either way the player
returns to the map to regroup and try again.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    ← your input traces (1–10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
